*This roadmap reflects my initiative for growing NVIDIA’s presence in scientific ML and AI research communities. I’d love to iterate on this with the team.*

*Project Draft*

---

## Objectives

- Support research labs in adopting deep learning and accelerated computing.
- Act as a technical bridge between NVIDIA’s products and the scientific ML community.
- Promote adoption of PhysicsNeMo, CUDA, and DLI via training and collaboration.

## First 3 Months – Integration & Engagement

### Lab Collaborations

- Initiate discussions with key labs where I have prior academic or research ties:
  - [HPC@Maths](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en/research/analysis/hpcmaths) Team of the Applied Mathematics lab of École polytechnique.
  - [Maison de la Simulation](https://mdls.fr/) Joint laboratory between CEA, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay.
  - [SERMA](https://www.pluginlabs-universiteparissaclay.fr/fiche/service-detudes-des-reacteurs-et-de-mathematiques-appliquees-serma/) Reactor physics lab of CEA.
  - [SGLS](https://www.pluginlabs-universiteparissaclay.fr/en/fiche/service-de-genie-logiciel-pour-la-simulation-sgls-2/) Software engineering for simulation lab of CEA.
  - [LJLL](https://www.ljll.fr/en/) Applied Mathematics lab of Sorbonne Université.
- Identify use cases for scientific ML (surrogate modeling, PINNs, inference).
- Connect PhD students and researchers with [NVIDIA DLI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/) certified training programs.
- Share my experience as a CUDA DLI trainee (during my PhD in 2021).
- Explore internship proposals and lightweight collaborative prototypes.
- Grant cloud computing credits.

### Summer School Engagement

- Target top summer/winter schools not yet covered by NVIDIA:
  - [The Gray Scott HPC summer school](https://www.lapp.in2p3.fr/en/2025-04-event-8392): 1 week CPU and 1 week GPU training
  - [CEA–INRIA–EDF HPC School](https://ecoles-cea-edf-inria.fr/en/): The topic of the school 2025 was Solving partial differential equations in fields physics faster with physics-based machine learning
  - [Hi! Paris Summer School on AI](https://www.hi-paris.fr/summer-school-2025/)
- Propose NVIDIA sponsorship and/or send trainers to deliver DLI modules.

---

### Conference Sponsorship & Outreach

- Identify and propose sponsorship opportunities in relevant applied math/AI conferences:
  - Mathematical Summer Center for Advanced Research in Scientific Computing [CEMRACS](https://cemracs2025.math.cnrs.fr/en/)
  - European Conference on Numerical Mathematics and Advanced Applications [ENUMATH](https://enumath2025.eu/)
  - National Numerical Analysis Congress [CANUM](https://canum2024.math.cnrs.fr/fr/)
  - International Conference on the Physics of Reactors [Physor 2026](https://www.physor2026.org/) in Torino
- Deliver demos, PhysicsNeMo workshops, or DLI technical talks.
- Full list: [SMAI Event Calendar](http://smai.emath.fr/spip.php?article76&lang=fr)

---

### Webinars & Enablement

- Host a public or academic webinar (e.g. “Getting Started with PhysicsNeMo for Scientific ML”).
- Write a technical blog post reflecting early feedback from researchers.
- Start a prototype PINN demo (e.g. solving the heat equation with PhysicsNeMo).

---

## 12-Month Milestone – Plasma Physics Prototype

### Deep Learning for Plasma Simulation

- Identify and contact plasma simulation labs:
  - ITER, ENSTA, INRIA's [CASTOR](https://team.inria.fr/castor/fr/) and [TONUS](https://team.inria.fr/tonus/) teams.
- Discuss use cases for PINNs, operator learning, or surrogate modeling.
- Build a PhysicsNeMo-based prototype for a simplified plasma PDE (e.g. magnetohydrodynamics).
- Benchmark vs traditional simulation methods (drawing on experience from CEA).
- Share outcomes in internal workshops or technical communities.

---

## Targeted Deliverables

- 3+ academic lab collaborations initiated
- 1 NVIDIA training or workshop delivered
- 1 summer school with NVIDIA content integrated
- 1 technical prototype developed and shared
- Technical blog post or internal note published
