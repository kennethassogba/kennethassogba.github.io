We study the use of Pn method in angle and Discontinuous Galerkin in space to solve 3D neutron
transport problem. Pn method consists in developing the angular flux on truncated spherical harmonics
basis. In this paper, we couple this method with the discontinuous finite elements in space to obtain a
complete discretisation of the multigroup neutron transport equation.

To investigate its precision, the
method was applied to Takeda and C5G7 benchmark problems. These calculations point out that the
proposed Pn -DG method is capable of producing accurate solutions in small computational time, and
that it is able to handle complex 3D geometries.
