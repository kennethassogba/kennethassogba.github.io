We combine spherical harmonics and discontinuous Galerkin to discretize the neutron transport equation.
The method can handle all geometries describing the fuel elements without any simplification nor homogenisation.
Moreover the use of matrix assembly-free method avoids building large sparse matrices, which enables to produce
high-order solutions in small computational time and less storage usage.

The resulting transport solver has a wide range of applications: it can be used for a core calculation as well as
for a precise 281-groups lattice calculation accounting anisotropic scattering.
