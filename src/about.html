    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Kenneth Assogba, and I'm a software engineer specializing in JavaScript-related
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in a small town in southern California. Singapore is home for me, but I'm in
      Beijing until November 2023.
    </p>
    <p>I tend to most enjoy working on things related to the web platform. Stuff like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with web standard APIs</li>
      <li>Manipulating the DOM</li>
      <li>Writing tooling that targets the web</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These days I'm exploring a few different interests, albeit slowly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building native clients for other platforms (e.g. iOS, macOS, Windows)</li>
      <li>Contributing to open source browser projects (e.g Servo, WebKit, Chromium)</li>
      <li>Exploring WASM and its toolchain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      None of these things map to job descriptions, so if you're looking for that here's a list of
      tools and technologies I've worked with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
      <li>Node, Deno</li>
      <li>React, React Native, Svelte</li>
      <li>Webpack, Babel, Rollup, Parcel, Vite</li>
      <li>Jest, Karma/Mocha/Chai/Sinon, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright</li>
      <li>REST, GraphQL</li>
      <li>AWS, GCP, Terraform</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Normally here's where I would link out to a bunch of online profiles, but I like to keep
      those to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would also be nice if the web was less about mega platforms and more about websites like
      this one.
    </p>
    <p>So, no links!</p>
