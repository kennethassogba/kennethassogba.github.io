    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a Research Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.siemens.com/">siemens</a>, contributing to the
      development of an FPGA prototyping platform for pre-silicon validation of integrated circuits.
    </p>
    
    <p>I enjoy applied mathematics and high-performance computing. I focus on building scalable, modular systems using SOLID principles and design patterns. I am also interested in software architecture and structuring systems for long-term success.
      I work daily with C++ and Python, and I am proficient in both. Some of my personal projects are available on my Github. In my spare time, I run a small (tiny?) blog where I write about my projects <a href="https://kennethassogba.github.io/notes">blog</a>. </p>

    <p>These days I'm exploring a few different interests, albeit slowly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributing to open source scientific computing projects</li>
      <li>Writing clean code using Test Driven Development and CI/CD</li>
      <li>Exploring Physics-Informed Neural Networks</li>
      <!-- <li>Building a solver for large-scale particle transport simulations</li> -->
    </ul>
    <!-- <p>
      Here's a list of tools and technologies I've worked with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>MPI, OpenMP</li>
    </ul> -->

    <p>
      I grew up in Benin, a small country in western africa. Sceaux, France is home for me.
    </p>

      Normally here's where I would link out to a bunch of online profiles.

      those to a minimum.

    <!-- <p>
      It would also be nice if the web was less about mega platforms and more about websites like
      this one.
    </p>
    <p>So, no links!</p> -->
